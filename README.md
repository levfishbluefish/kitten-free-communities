# Kitten Free Communities
*Getting the feral cat population under control, one neighborhood at a time*

## Mission Statement
**Kitten Free Communities** is a California Bay Area based initiative with the goal of empowering individuals and neighborhoods to take ownership of their feral cat population and work towards becoming `#kitten-free`

## What is `#kitten-free` ?
`#kitten-free` refers to the goal of a neighborhood, city, state, and ultimately country wide, status of getting the feral cat population under control so that no new kittens are born outside. This project aims to systematically create `#kitten-free` streets and neighborhoods by getting the people who live there to accept and take ownership of their colonies.

## Why do we need this?

### There are too many homeless kittens born each year
Each year thousands of kittens are born in our community. [Town Cats](https://www.towncats.org/towncats/feral-cats/) estimates there are 125,000 homeless cats in **Santa Clara County alone**, and 60 t0 160 **million** feral cats in the USA. While volunteers work tirelessly TNR, the numbers continue to rise year after year. It is our belief that **no one group or organization can do it alone.** 

## How do we plan on doing this?

### Working Together is Key
Rescue efforts, non-profits, shelters, and local groups often do not communicate or collaborate with each other. This limits the scalability of any individual groups effots and limits their impact. KFC believes we need to create an organized effort with as many players as possible to increase our effectiveness.

### Animal Welfare Volunteers are Not Enough
The truth of it is, we need more people. While a handfull of dedicated volunteers TNR, rescue, and feed our communities colonies, they simply cannot do it all. A single trapper can answer a request for trapping a single cat, but without *living* in that neighborhood and watching the cats movments over a period of time, they cannot hope to ascertain the scope of the immediate cat population. 

### Crowd-Sourcing Information & Implementation
Individuals who see, find, or feed cats in their neighborhoods, in the backyards, and on their street corners, need to feel empowered to TNR their own colonies. It is much easier for an individual to note which cats come to their backyard each day and trap any unfixed cats than it is for a single trapper to travel to a different neighborhood and attempt the same thing.

We at the KFC believe the key to getting the feral cat population undercontrol is to educate and empower local communities to manage their local colonies.

## How will we acheive this?

- Create and maintain a database of feral cat colonies, local rescue, shelter, and volunteer groups
- Setup county, city, and neighborhood chapters in a NextDoor style community
