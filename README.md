# Mission Statement
**Kitten Free Communities** is a California Bay Area based initiative with the goal of empowering individuals and neighborhoods to take ownership of their feral cat population and work towards becoming `#kitten-free`. 

## What is `#kitten-free`
`#kitten-free` refers to the goal of a neighborhood, city, state, and ultimately country wide, status of getting the feral cat population under control so that no new kittens are born outside. This project aims to systematically create `#kitten-free` streets and neighborhoods by getting the people who live there to accept and take ownership of their colonies.
